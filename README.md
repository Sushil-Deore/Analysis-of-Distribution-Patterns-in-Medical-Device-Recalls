## Understanding Recalls
A recall is an essential and legally mandated action taken to address issues with a medical device that violate the laws and regulations administered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. These issues can encompass a range of concerns, from defects that compromise a device's functionality to situations where a device poses potential health risks, and even scenarios where both issues are intertwined.
To define it formally, a recall, according to 21 CFR 7.3(g), is "a firm's removal or correction of a marketed product that the Food and Drug Administration considers to be in violation of the laws it administers and against which the agency would initiate legal action, e.g., seizure. Recall does not include a market withdrawal or a stock recovery." When a firm initiates a recall to mitigate health risks, it is obligated to provide a detailed written report to the FDA, including the information stipulated in 21 CFR 806.10.

## The Context of Medical Device Recalls
Medical device recalls are not isolated incidents but are part of a broader system aimed at ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. These recalls can impact a wide array of medical specialties, from cardiovascular devices to orthopedic instruments and beyond. They are not only critical to patient safety but also to maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the healthcare system as a whole.
Over the years, the landscape of medical device recalls has evolved, driven by advancements in technology and changes in regulations. Understanding the historical trends and the specific devices involved in recalls can provide valuable insights into the state of healthcare and the areas that require further attention and improvement.
